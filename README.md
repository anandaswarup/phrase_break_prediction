# Phrase break prediction using BLSTM

This repository contains code to train a phrase break prediction system for Text-to-Speech systems using BLSTMs and word embeddings. The sytem is trained used LibriTTS alignments provided at [kan-bayashi/LibriTTSLabel](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/LibriTTSLabel)
 

# Quick start
## Train TTS from scratch
1. Download the dataset [kan-bayashi/LibriTTSLabel](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/LibriTTSLabel)
